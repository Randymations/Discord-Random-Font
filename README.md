# Discord Random Font
A Better Discord plugin that loads a random font from Google's font sever upon Discord's launch.

Currently no settings, just load and use.
Recommended use with [Toggle Your Stuff](https://github.com/Inve1951/BetterDiscordStuff/blob/master/coffee/toggleYourStuff.plugin.coffee) for easy toggle and font switching.

Code adapted for use on Discord from [here](https://codepen.io/akobashikawa/pen/rZRrQN).
